## Developer Notes
*Our code still includes bugs that may hinder the ease-of-use of our program, and some functionalities like editing and deleting a location. However the major functionalities have been implemented. Please see the Project Board for further information.*

*Complete deployment from the .jar file is functional, with an exception of certain constraints due to a lack of time to fix all the bugs. One of the biggest constraints is that the editing function does not work when running from the .jar file.*

## Happy Touring!
