# **Software Design Project**

Eve Murphy Beaudet & Devishi Soni 

## Project Overview ##
This project aims to provide users with relevant information on Canadian landmarks from a large database. Designed for ease of use, it allows users to add and remove landmarks from the catalog, log in and out of their accounts, search and filter entries, save favorites, leave reviews, and receive location-based recommendations.

## Iteration 1

### Goals:
1. Set up a working environment including a home page and a login page.
2. Integrate all requirements for this iteration.

### Requirements and Time Estimates: 
1. Set up data base & architecture (Must Have): 15 hours
2. Login (Must Have): 3 hours
3. Logout (Must Have): 3 hours
4. Add from Main Catalogue (Must Have): 4 hours
5. Delete from Main Catalogue (Must Have): 4 hours

The main goal of this iteration is to make sure we have the basic functionality of our application ready to present to the customer which includes most but not all of the customer's must have requirements!

**Reminder: We will all meet on Tuesday from 2:00pm - 3:30pm to integrate the code all together to be ready for our demo!**

Happy Coding!
