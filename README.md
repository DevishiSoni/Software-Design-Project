# **Software Design Project**

Eve Murphy Beaudet & Devishi Soni 

**Reminder: We will all meet on Tuesdays from 2:00pm - 3:00pm for our weekly updates!**

## Project Overview ##
This project aims to provide users with relevant information on Canadian landmarks from a large database. Designed for ease of use, it allows users to add and remove landmarks from the catalog, log in and out of their accounts, search and filter entries, save favorites, leave reviews, and receive location-based recommendations.

## Iteration 2:

### Goals:
1. Set up version control system - so user can build and run the program on their local device
2. Setting up test cases for classes to complete unit-level testing
3. Confirm requirements with the customer and complete the following fucntionalities of the software:
     a. Searching
     b. Filtering
     c. Add photos of landmarks (time permitting add a brief description of the location)
   Complete these functionalities while keeping in mind that application should be aesthetically pleasing and user friendly!

### Burndown Chart & State Chart Diagrams:

### Running the MVP (To be updated!)

1. Clone the repository using this link [Repo Link](https://github.com/DevishiSoni/Software-Design-Project.git)
2. Make sure the IDE of your choice has java installed, (we've used IntelliJ as our IDE)
3. Run the LoginServer.java file first and then run the LoginGUI.java file to launch the application


## Iteration 1

### Goals:
1. Set up a working environment including a home page and a login page.
2. Integrate all requirements for this iteration.

### Requirements and Time Estimates: 
1. Set up data base & architecture (Must Have): 15 hours
2. Login (Must Have): 3 hours
3. Logout (Must Have): 3 hours
4. Add from Main Catalogue (Must Have): 4 hours
5. Delete from Main Catalogue (Must Have): 4 hours

### Current challenges:
1. UI ease of use and aesthetics.

The main goal of this iteration is to make sure we have the basic functionality of our application ready to present to the customer which includes most but not all of the customer's must have requirements!





Happy Coding!
